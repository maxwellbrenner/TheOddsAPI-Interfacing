# UFC Odds Data Integration Pipeline

## Project Functionality

This project provides a three-stage pipeline to interface with UFC data, preprocess betting odds, and append them to detailed fight data. The result is a consolidated dataset that combines event details, fighter statistics, and odds information. 

The project workflow is organized as follows:

1. **API Interfacing**: The first notebook interfaces with `TheOddsAPI` to retrieve `h2h` (head-to-head) UFC closing lines across a number of online sportsbooks.
2. **Odds Preprocessing**: The second notebook preprocesses `cleaned_event_masterlist.csv` (generated by `UFCStats Scraper`) for odds integration.
3. **Appending Odds Data**: The final notebook combines odds data and UFC performance statistisc into a structured csv.

## Program Workflow

### 1. API Interfacing Program - `(1) API Interfacing.ipynb`

This program interfaces with `TheOddsAPI` to retrieve closing lines for UFC fights, covering events from `June 6, 2020` onward – the first date `TheOddsAPI` began archiving UFC `head-to-head` odds.

1. **Load Event Master List**: It begins by loading an existing `cleaned_event_masterlist.csv` file. This file contains a historical list of UFC event dates, which are essential for cross-referencing with TheOddsAPI data.
   
2. **Filter Event Dates by Date Range**: The program filters the event dates within a specified date range, which can be customized. A 12-hour offset is applied to each event date to standardize times across time zones.

3. **Retrieve Historical Odds**: For each filtered event date, the program queries TheOddsAPI to retrieve the historical odds data for that date. The odds are retrieved in the "head-to-head" format and include details such as:
   - **Event Date and Time**: Specific timestamps of the events.
   - **Fighter Odds**: Head-to-head betting lines for each fighter.
   - **Bookmaker and Market Data**: Information about the bookmakers providing odds and the types of odds markets available (e.g., head-to-head).

4. **Save Odds Data to CSV**: All odds data is saved into a CSV file, dynamically named according to the specified date range. The CSV format includes essential fields, making it compatible for further data analysis and integration with UFC event details in other notebooks.

## Data Collected

The data collected includes:

- **Event Details**: Information about each event, including the event date, home team, and away team (fighters).
- **Betting Odds**: Closing odds for each event, covering the head-to-head market and including details for each fighter's price (odds).
- **Bookmaker Information**: Bookmaker details and the specific market for each betting outcome.

### 2. Masterlist Preprocessing Program - `(2) Preprocessing Masterlist for Odds Data.ipynb`
This program preprocesses UFC event data (`cleaned_event_masterlist.csv`) to standardize fighter names and filter for essential columns, ensuring consistency and relevance in the dataset for further analysis and integration with betting odds data.

The program performs the following primary tasks:

1. **Load and Prepare Data**: It begins by loading the `cleaned_event_masterlist.csv` file, which contains UFC event, fight, and fighter details, into a DataFrame.

2. **Standardize Fighter Names**: Using a dictionary of name replacements, the program checks each fighter's name and replaces it if a more standardized or official name is available. This ensures that names match across different data sources and are consistent with official UFC records. If a name replacement affects the winner field, the program updates the winner’s name accordingly to maintain accuracy.

3. **Filter for Essential Columns**: The program reduces the dataset to a focused set of columns, discarding any that are not directly relevant to the analysis. This simplifies the dataset and improves compatibility with other parts of the analysis pipeline.

4. **Save Cleaned Data**: The cleaned DataFrame is saved as a new CSV file, ready for use in subsequent analysis steps -> `preprocessed_event_masterlist.csv`

### 3. Appending Odds Data Program - `(3) Appending Odds Data.ipynb`

In the final stage, this notebook matches and appends odds data to each fight in `cleaned_event_masterlist.csv`. It performs the following key functions:

#### Matching Odds to Fights
The program matches betting odds to each fight record based on:
- **Event Date**: Ensuring odds data corresponds with the event date.
- **Fighter Names**: Using fuzzy matching for consistent name matching.

#### Calculating Average and Best Odds
For each fight:
- The program calculates average odds by averaging implied probabilities from multiple bookmakers.
- It identifies the best available odds and their associated bookmakers.

#### Final Output
The program appends the calculated average and best odds to each fight and saves the final output as `event_masterlist_with_odds.csv`. This file includes:
- **Event and Fight Details**: Basic details such as event name, fight outcome, and weight class.
- **Betting Odds Data**: Average and best odds for each fighter with associated bookmaker details.

This consolidated dataset is analysis-ready for sports modeling, statistical analysis, or integration with other datasets.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `requests`: For interfacing with the UFC API.
- `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`: For parsing HTML content from the API.
- `pandas`: For data handling, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- `datetime`: For managing date formats in event and odds data.

## Example CSV Output

The final output file, `event_masterlist_with_odds.csv`, includes structured columns with details for each event, fight, and betting odds, as outlined below:

### Event and Fight Information
- **event_name**: Name of the UFC event.
- **event_date**: Date of the event.
- **fighter_a_name**: Name of Fighter A.
- **fighter_b_name**: Name of Fighter B.
- **winner**: Name of the fight’s winner.
- **method_of_victory**: Method of victory (e.g., KO/TKO, Decision).
- **round_of_victory**: Round in which the fight concluded.
- **weightclass**: Weight class of the fight.

### Betting Odds Data
- **Fighter A Avg Odds**: Average odds calculated for Fighter A.
- **Fighter A Best Odds**: Best odds available for Fighter A, with the bookmaker.
- **Fighter B Avg Odds**: Average odds calculated for Fighter B.
- **Fighter B Best Odds**: Best odds available for Fighter B, with the bookmaker.

The dataset is formatted for detailed analysis, modeling, or integration with other sports data sources.
